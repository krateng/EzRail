## How to use

* Define a station platform by putting a copper block two blocks underneath the rail, then adding a sign in the direction of travel with the following content:

```
Station Name|Platform Number
Next, Stops, In,
This, Direction
```

Then add another copper block in the same fashion, but without a sign, up to 50 blocks away. This block determines when the plugin will start handling incoming rails.
